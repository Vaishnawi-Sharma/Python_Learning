# partition() method always returns a tuple with three elementsâ€”even if the separator isn't found in the string. This is a key characteristic of how partition() works in Python.

# If the separator exists in the string:

# The string is split into three parts: before, the separator, and after.

# If the separator does not exist, like in your example (text.partition(",") where , is missing):

# The entire string remains unchanged.

# The separator part is an empty string ("").

# The part after the separator is also an empty string ("").
